Write a proxy for the hue lamp

Fresh machine

zypper in salt-proxy

The proxy is called proxy1

On proxy1, add a file /etc/salt/proxy:

master: master

On the master, create a file /srv/pillar/top.sls:

base:
  'proxy1':
   - proxy1

Create a file "proxy1.sls":

proxy:
  proxytype: hue_bridge
  bridge_url: Philips-hue
  api_user: newdeveloper

On proxy1:
  
salt-proxy --proxyid=proxy1 -l debug

Accept the key:

on master:

salt-key -a proxy1

(this will only work after the below has been added as well)

Hacky:

on proxy1

md /hue

cd /hue

touch hue_bridge.py

cd /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/proxy/

ln -s /hue/hue_bridge.py ./

make sure we have requests:

zypper in python-requests (seems to be a dependency of something else anyway)

Put the hue_bridge.py code in

Works!
